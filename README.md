# Pandas Challenge

[This repository](https://github.com/anulkar/pandas-challenge) contains two Jupyter Notebooks with viewable Pandas DataFrames, details of which are below.

## Heroes of Pymoli
* **Jupyter Notebook**: [HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb](https://github.com/anulkar/pandas-challenge/blob/master/HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb)
  * This notebook analyzes the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. The game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. Using python and pandas, it breaks down the game's [purchasing data](https://github.com/anulkar/pandas-challenge/blob/master/HeroesOfPymoli/Resources/purchase_data.csv) into meaningful insights.
* **Purchasing Data Insights**
  * Gender Demographics analysis suggests that while majority of the players who played the game and made a purchase were *Male* (**over 84%**), the *Average Purchase Price* as well as *Average Total Purchase Per Person* for *Female* players was slightly higher compared to Male players (). This suggests that the gaming company should potentially target Female players as they are equally (or more) likely to purchase options as Male players do, which could potentially lead to higher revenue streams for the company.
  * As far as the Age Demographics is concerned, the data indicates that purchases are largely popular among the 15-29 age group, which constitutes for over **75%** of the total players, out of which almost **45%** are in the 20-24 age group. On the other hand, the *Average Total Purchase per Person* in the under-10 age group as well as the older 35-39 age group is over $4.50 and the highest amongst all age groups, which suggests that the company has an untapped potential market for both younger and older gamers.
  * Comparing the *Most Popular Items* and *Most Profitable Items* the 5th most popular item *"Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy"* was purchased **8** times but has a significantly low *Total Purchase Value* of **$8.16**, because the item is priced only at **$1.02**, hence the item is not as profitable as some of the other popular items. The company should review this item to see it's being under-priced, or if there is a strategic reason to keep it under-priced, yet popular.

## Academy of Py
* **Jupyter Notebook**: [PyCitySchools.ipynb](https://github.com/anulkar/pandas-challenge/blob/master/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb) 
  * This notebook analyzes district-wide standardized test results to aid in strategic decision-making regarding future school budgets and priorities. Using python and pandas, it aggregates [students' math and reading scores](https://github.com/anulkar/pandas-challenge/blob/master/PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv) as well as various information on the [schools they attend](https://github.com/anulkar/pandas-challenge/blob/master/PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) in order to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
